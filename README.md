Wayward Zoo is a web application for the STEM Warrior Hacks Dec 31-Jan 2 Hackathon. 

It is a randomized zoology information app that offers interesting information without the uneeded and overwhelming 'filler' of fish species. This uses the Fishwatch API https://www.fishwatch.gov/developers, providing a mega list of all fish in the world. It provides info from endangerement status to texture in food. Using this, I selected specific key-value pairs from the given json list, and so that individuals would be able to read and learn about whichever fish they were lucky enough to see. 

The purpose of this is to provide a platform for individuals interested in zoology that are not children. The idea, limited by my experience, is to provide interesting and important information without focusing on useless filler. We want to engage people, but understand zoology can be overwhelming. The focus is to show that users do not need to undersand everything about ecology and every individual species, and can rather just see how random animals are distinct and really cool!

An ideal system would have:
- A tracker to ensure a lack of repeats
- A search system, when the user is looking for a specific fish. 
- Outreach to other types of animals (The user could also choose if they wanted)


This was my first time using an api on my own, without a hand-holding guide. It was tough, there was a lot of information, planning, and
